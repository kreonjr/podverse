Podverse

***Getting Started***

Podverse uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies, but (I think?) you do not have to install CocoaPods to begin developing Podverse.

All you need to remember is to open the podverse.xcworkspace file (which is integrated with CocoaPod dependencies) in XCode, AND DO NOT use podverse.xcodeproj.

If these instructions do not work, then (we need to fix them!) the information you need to successfully set up the project can be found here: http://swiftalicio.us/2014/11/using-cocoapods-from-swift/

You will need to install CocoaPods to manage dependencies for Podverse. Installation can be as simple as running the following command in your terminal:

$ sudo gem install cocoapods

(For more information about installing CocoaPods, visit http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started)

Once you have CocoaPods installed, change into the directory that contains the Podfile (should be /Podverse/Podfile ), then type the following command:

pod install

This will create a podverse.xcworkspace file. You should use the podverse.xcworkspace file from now on.

***MWFeedParser***

One of Podverse's dependencies is MWFeedParser, which is third-party free software that simplifies extracting information from RSS feeds.

Please note that we have modified MWFeedParser specifically to support Podverse's use case, so and Podverse will not work without this customized version of MWFeedParser.
